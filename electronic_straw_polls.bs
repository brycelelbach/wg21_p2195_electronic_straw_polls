# Motivation and Summary # {#motivation-summary}

The Standard C++ Committee is starting to conduct more and more of our
  technical work in a virtual environment (see [[P2145R0]]), in part due to
  the current global pandemic.
This switch to remote work has required us to make changes to how we meet and
  collaborate.

To have effective virtual meetings, we need to evolve our consensus building
  process, because it has traditionally been in-person only.
We are will not meet in-person again until it is possible to do so without
  putting peoples' lives at risk, and we do not when that will be.

We therefore propose that the Evolution and Library Evolution chairs be able to
  conduct [=straw polls=] asynchronously through an electronic polling service
  on isocpp.org.
We separate polls into two categories: [=Direction Straw Polls=] and
  [=Decision Straw Polls=].

We focus on the evolution groups because, so far, study groups and
  the core groups have been able to advance work without too many issues.
In large parts, this is because study groups are focused interest groups who
  forward to evolutions groups.
Similarly, core groups are smaller and have more focus, and controversial design
  discussions tend to occur prior to reaching the core groups.

This proposal doesn't address what work should be prioritized or the process by
  which a proposal moves through the committee.
These important tasks are performed by [[P0592R4]] (prioritization) and
  [[P2138R2]] (proposal flow).

## Proposal Summary ## {#tldr}

In short, we propose:

* Continuing virtual teleconferences, which hone design and provide
    non-binding design direction.
* Begin holding quarterly asynchronous electronic polls through a web service
    on isocpp.org.
* Anything that is judged ready for a binding decision poll is put on the
    next applicable quarterly poll.
* Polls can be added to the quarterly list up to a month before the poll
    opens.
* A teleconference is held one week before polls close to hold technical
    discussions which haven't been addressed over email or at prior
    teleconferences.
* The impact and effectiveness of all the above should be monitored and
    changes should be proposed to improve the process as needed.

In a way, this is a mini-train model embedded into C++'s larger 3-year release
  train schedule:

* Releases every three years.
* Decision polls every quarter.
* Mailings every month.
* Teleconferences every week.

## Consensus Building Mechanisms ## {#consensus-building-mechanisms}

<dfn>Synchronous Consensus Building</dfn> is a process for building consensus
  in which those involved meet at an appointed time (face-to-face or via
  telecon), discuss the subject matter, and then work to reach a consensus
  position before the end of the meeting.

<dfn>Asynchronous Consensus Building</dfn> is a process for building consensus
  in which a deadline is set, those involved discuss the subject matter (email,
  face-to-face, and/or telecon), and then work to reach a consensus decision
  before the deadline.

One of the main motivations for [=synchronous consensus building=] is that
  it attempts to ensure that those voting on a poll are informed on the subject
  matter, as they were present for the discussion of it.
However, despite our best efforts, we cannot force participants to be engaged
  and follow the discussion, even if they are present.

There are a number of downsides to [=synchronous consensus building=]:

* It limits stakeholder involvement to those who can present at the meeting.
    For face-to-face meeting, this requires participants to travel to the
      meeting location.
    For telecons, it is almost impossible to avoid excluding some stakeholders
      due to time zone constraints.
* It often forces stakeholders present at meetings to choose which decisions
      they wish to be involved with.
    At the last few face-to-face meetings, we have had seven concurrent
      subgroup meetings for most of the week; it is almost impossible to avoid
      conflicts.
    For telecons, it is almost impossible to avoid excluding some stakeholders
      due to schedule constraints.
* It limits the amount of discussion that can proceed making a decision.
    Synchronous meeting time is a precious and limited resource.
* It does not leave time for reflection and reconsideration.
    [=Synchronous consensus building=] asks us to make a decision immediately
      after a discussion.
    While we can almost always reconsider decisions in light of new information
      or new perspectives, it is often wise to give stakeholders more time than
      a synchronous meeting can last to think about the decision and
      investigate open questions they may have.

[=Asynchronous consensus building=] addresses many of these shortcomings.
It allows more stakeholders to be involved in consensus building, equalizing
  the field by removing barriers to participation.
It removes the pressure and hastiness of trying to determine consensus before
  the end of a meeting, giving stakeholders more time to contemplate and decide
  their position.
This ensures that all opinions are ensured equally in the consensus building
  process, resulting in a better standard.

However, [=asynchronous consensus building=] does have downsides as well:

* It may make it easier to vote in a poll without participating in the discussion
    or knowledge of the subject matter.
* Discussion and polling are not temporally tightly coupled, which may make it
    harder for participants to remain informed on the subject matter at the time
    of the poll.
* The lead time for taking a poll is greater, which means it is harder to retake
    polls and take follow-up polls.

We recognize that these may be issues, but we've taken steps to mitigate them and
  we believe the upsides outweigh the downsides.
It is important to note that we make decisions by consensus, not majority vote.
If a chair believes that the results of a poll are not an accurate representation
  of the consensus of the group, the chair may decide there's no consensus on
  the poll despite the numeric results and the poll can be retaken after a
  renewed discussion that seeks to improve consensus.

Ultimately, there is a tradeoff between [=synchronous consensus building=] and
  [=asynchronous consensus building=]; we believe that using a combination of
  both mechanisms is the right choice for C++ today.

## Prior Art ## {#prior-art}

Historically, consensus building within the Standard C++ Committee has been
  synchronous and has occured at face-to-face meetings:

* <dfn>Straw Polls</dfn>: Evolution and study groups have used informal polls
      during face-to-face meetings to decide whether to pursue proposals,
      provide directions for future revisions of proposals, make policy
      decisions, and forward proposals to other groups or plenaries.
    Anyone physically in attendance when a [=straw poll=] is taken is allowed to
      participate, including those who are visitors and do not yet have formal
      membership in a National Body.
    Typically, chairs discourage those who were not present for the discussion
      preceding the poll to not vote, but they are not disallowed from doing so.
    Decisions made in this way are not strictly binding; if new information or
      new perspectives are discovered, decisions can always be revisited.
* <dfn>Plenary Polls</dfn>: More formal polls are taken during plenaries at
      face-to-face meetings.
    Only formal Committee members may participate in plenary polls.
    Plenary polls are used to approve changes to the working draft of the C++
      International Standard or a C++ Technical Specification, create or advance
      work items to the next stage in their publication cycle, and make
      Committee-wide policy decisions.
    In the past few years, we have avoided technical discussion on the subject
      matter of a plenary poll during the plenary itself; technical discussion
      is supposed to happen in the applicable study groups prior to plenary.

Some of the decisions made at plenary meetings, such as the creation and
  advancement of work items through their publication cycle, lead to
  asynchronous electronic polls at the ISO level which then trickle down to
  our National Bodies, each of which uses their own consensus building process.
Typically these ISO polls are open for a few weeks or months, giving ample time
  for stakeholders to consider the subject matter and make up their mind.

The parent organization of the US National Body, INCITS,
  [=Asynchronous Consensus Building|builds consensus asynchronously=] through
  electronic polls or calls for comments which are open for a few weeks or
  months.

Another ISO programming language committee, the Standard Fortran Committee,
  makes synchronous decisions at face-to-face meetings.
However, many of these decisions are considered preliminary and are followed up
  with an electronic polls within the Committee to determine consensus.
The below excerpt describes their process for one particular type of poll:

> The rules for interpretation handling by which we operate say:
>
> * J3 votes on the answer at a J3 meeting; a simple majority vote marks the
>     answer as "passed by J3 meeting".
> * Between J3 meetings the chair of /interp sends a J3 letter ballot to J3 to
>       approve interp answers that have been "passed by J3 meeting".
>     The letter ballot runs for 30 days.
>     An interp answer passes by a 2/3rds vote; a no vote must be accompanied by
>       an explanation of the changes necessary to change the member's vote to
>       yes.
>     J3/interp reserves the right to recall an interp answer for more study
>       even if the answer passes.

# Proposed Changes # {#proposed-changes}

Today, the purpose of meetings is to make decisions.
Work on proposals is largely done outside of meetings.
At meetings, we review proposals, identifying where additional work is needed
  before a decision is made, and, when sufficient information is available,
  making decisions about how and if a proposal should proceed.

We propose a new model, where the purpose of meetings is to drive decision
  making, but not require that the decision making happen at the meetings
  themselves.
Meetings would continue to be used to review and refine proposals and identify
  open questions.
However, instead of focusing on making decisions at meetings, we would instead
  focus on identifying the decisions that need to be made.

We propose that language and library evolution chairs have the option to conduct
  [=straw polls=] asynchronously through an electronic polling service on
  isocpp.org to determine consensus.

Henceforth, [=straw polls=] should be divided into two categories:

* <dfn>Direction Straw Polls</dfn>: These polls are taken to reaffirm a proposal's
      direction, or suggest direction changes that a proposal should pursue in the
      next revision that comes before the study group taking the poll.
    These polls will usually be taken on younger proposals, where there are still
      many open questions and areas for additional investigation.
    Direction [=straw polls=] can only be taken on proposals that will return to
      the same evolution or study group before proceeding further.
    Dissent should be recorded, so that authors know what work needs to be performed
      to increase consensus in the next revision of their proposal.
    The results of these polls can always be revisited if new information or new
      perspectives are discovered.
* <dfn>Decision Straw Polls</dfn>: These polls are taken to make decisions
      regarding a proposal once the evolution or study group is confident that
      all applicable and relevant aspects of the decision have been discussed.
    These polls will typically be taken on proposals that have been in the
      evolution or study group for a few revisions, but can also be taken when a
      proposal is an obvious one to approve, or when a proposal clearly has no
      chance of gaining consensus and should not be pursued further.
    Decision [=straw polls=] may forward proposals to other evolution groups,
      study groups, or to plenary, as well as halt the progress of a proposal.
    The results of these polls can always be revisited if new information or new
      perspectives are discovered.

We propose that the following guidelines should be followed when determining
  whether a poll should be taken synchronously or asynchronously:

In Evolution and Library Evolution, at the chair's discretion,

* [=decision straw polls=] shall be conducted either:
    * synchronously at face-to-face meetings, but not virtual meetings,
          (status quo), or
    * asynchronously via electronic straw poll.
* [=direction straw polls=] shall be conducted either:
    * synchronously at face-to-face or virtual meetings (status quo), or
    * asynchronously via electronic straw poll.

# Electronic Straw Poll Specification # {#electronic-straw-poll-specification}

Electronic [=straw polls=] shall be conducted through a service on isocpp.org.

## Poll Structure ## {#poll-structure}

The service shall support five-way polls.

A five-way poll consists of an arbitrary statement, determined by the applicable
  chair. The polarity of the poll shall be that voting "in favor" means changing
  the current status-quo.
Poll statements shall not be changed after the poll has begun.

Polls should provide links to relevant published P- or N-numbered papers
  applicable to the polls, relevant minutes for those papers, prior polls, and
  the <a href="https://github.com/cplusplus/papers/issues">GitHub issue</a> for
  said papers.

In a five-way poll, voters may select a stance on the statement being polled
  from these five options:

* Strongly Favor.
* Weakly Favor.
* Neutral.
* Weakly Against.
* Strongly Against.

## Eligibility for Voting ## {#eligibility-for-voting}

The service shall use the same login system as the isocpp.org paper submission
  service.

An individual is eligible to obtain an isocpp.org account and participate in an
  evolution or study group's electronic [=straw polls=] if they are any of the
  following:

* A member of a National Body that participates in the Standard C++ Committee,
    e.g. someone who is in the ISO Global Directory.
* Any person who has attended one of the past three face-to-face meetings.

## Voting ## {#voting}

Each voter may participate once on each poll.

Voters shall leave a comment in addition to their vote.

Each voter may change their vote and comment at any time prior to the closing of
  a vote.

Each voter should be prompted to confirm that they have read the proposal and
  are familiar with the topic.

The voting system shall follow best practices for accessibility.
If any voter is unable to vote using the voting system for whatever reason, they
  may submit their vote by emailing the chair who created the poll.

## Creation of Polls ## {#creation-of-polls}

Chairs may create polls.

## Discussion Prior to Polling ## {#discussion-prior-to-polling}

The subject of a poll shall be discussed either at a meeting or via the
  applicable mailing list prior to the start of a poll.

Chairs shall notify attendees of a teleconference when a teleconference poll
  aims to place a new poll in the upcoming quarterly poll. If the
  teleconference poll has consensus, the poll shall be put on the upcoming
  quarterly poll, at least a month before the poll period closes. Any
  teleconference poll taken in the month leading to a quarterly poll is
  instead scheduled for the subsequent quarter's poll.

## Poll Notifications ## {#poll-notifications}

A new mailing list, polls@lists.isocpp.org, shall be established.
This mailing list shall be used for notifications regarding polls, but not for
  discussions of polls or poll results.

Once a poll has been scheduled for an upcoming quarterly poll, chairs shall
  notify the applicable mailing lists and polls@lists.isocpp.org.

At the start of any teleconference meeting, if that group has open polls, the
  chair shall notify the group of said polls.

## Poll Duration ## {#poll-duration}

Polls are open for no less than a month before a quarterly poll closes.

## Poll Results ## {#poll-results}

The position and comments of all voters shall remain hidden, until the poll
  closes.
When the poll closes, the position and comments shall be visible to all
  committee members (not the general public) and shall be attributed to
  the voter who made them.

Once a poll closes, the chair who created the poll shall receive an email
  notifying them that the poll is over.
Then, the chair who created the poll shall distribute their interpretation of
  what consensus is based on the poll results via the applicable mailing lists,
  minutes pages, and/or GitHub issues.

No one shall share the identities and positions of voters with those who are
  not eligible voters without the explicit permission of said voters.
Poll statements, vote counts, and the chair's interpretation of the results
  may be shared with anyone.

# FAQ # {#faq}

<b>Q: Do you think we should stop having face-to-face meetings entirely?</b>

No.

Developing processes for collaborating remotely and electronically does not mean
  ceasing our face-to-face collaborations.
Face-to-face meetings have value and we believe face-to-face meetings should
  be held in the future.
We do believe that enabling remote participation in such meetings is important.

<b>Q: Won't electronic [=straw polls=] allow people who weren't involved in discussion at a meeting to vote?</b>

Yes.

In synchronous decision making, we discourage those who were not present for the
  discussion prior to a poll from voting because they do not have time to
  familiarize themselves with the discussion before the poll is taken.
In asynchronous decision making, those not present for a discussion will have
  ample time to familiarize themselves with the discussion and background.

It is true that some people may choose to not familiarize themselves with the
  subject matter and prior discussions and still vote.
However, synchronous decision making is also susceptible to inattentiveness.
The presence of an individual at a particular meeting does not imply that they
  were paying attention during the meeting.

The best we can do is what we have always done: encourage people to either
  familiarize themselves with the subject matter and discussion or choose to not
  vote. It is important to expect and assume that all Committee participants
  are acting professionally and in good-faith.

Additionally, unlike at face-to-face meetings, chairs will have a list of
  everyone who voted in the poll and how they voted.
If any sort of voting irregularities appear, the added transparency will make
  it very noticable.
If such irregularities do occur, we can correct them and adjust our process.

We make decisions by consensus, not majority.
If the chair has reason to believe the results of the poll do not reflect the
  consensus of the group, the poll can be discarded and the subject matter
  revisited.

For example, suppose we had this result:

<blockquote>
<b>POLL: Use asynchronous electronic straw polls to determine consensus in
  Library</b>

<table>
<tr>
<th>Strongly For
<th>Weakly For
<th>Neutral
<th>Weakly Against
<th>Strongly Against
<tr>
<td>5
<td>3
<td>10
<td>1
<td>0
</table>
</blockquote>

This poll result might appear to have weak consensus.
But, suppose also that:

* All 8 of the people who voted strongly or weakly for the poll were authors of
    the proposal and were new to Library Evolution.
* Most of the 10 people who voted neutral were regular attendees of Library
    Evolution, and noted in their poll comment that they voted neutral because
    they felt they did not understand the proposal.
* The 1 person who voted weakly against was a long time regular member of
    Library Evolution who read the proposal very thoroughly and provided a
    lot of feedback to the authors, and mentioned in their comment that they
    felt no steps had been taken to address their feedback.

In this circumstance, a chair may determine that there is no consensus on this
  matter.
The chair would inform the authors and the group that the poll was inconclusive
  and would have to be retaken after another round of discussions.
They would also provide the authors with some guidance on what steps they might
  take to ensure that more stakeholders understand and adopt an informed
  position on the matter before it is polled again.

<b>Q: Will my vote and comments on a poll be publicly attributed to me outside of the committee?</b>

No, unless you choose to make them public yourself.

Poll results will follow the same rules we use for minutes today:

* The poll statement, numeric results, and chair's interpretation of consensus
    of a poll can be made publicly available.
* Anonymized summaries of comments can be made publicly available.
* Attribution of votes or comments to specific individuals, companies, or
    National Bodies without their express permission is forbidden.

<b>Q: What about plenary and [=plenary polls=]?</b>

This proposal does not suggest any changes to our plenary process at this time.
We believe incremental change is safer than drastic change.
We suggest that the Standard C++ Committee start pursuing electronic
  [=straw polls=] for evolution groups and assess the effectiveness and ramifications
  of this change in a few months before considering further process changes.

There is no pressing need to hold a plenary meeting for the next few months.
We do not need to advance any Standard C++ work items to the next publication
  stage in the immediate future.

In the future, if we decide to electronically conduct [=plenary polls=], there
  are already systems in place to handle electronic polling of formal
  individual members within an ISO committee.
ISO provides a electronic polling system which we could use to poll the
  individual membership.
ISO polls for creating or advancing work items to the next publication stage
  are voted on by National Bodies, not the individual members.
However, ISO provides another type of poll,
  <a href="https://helpdesk-docs.iso.org/article/318-create-wg">Working Group consultations</a>,
  which the formal individual members of a Committee vote on.

Given that technical discussion is already discouraged for [=plenary polls=] and
  is intended to happen disjointly in evolution and study groups prior the
  plenary, electronic voting for [=plenary polls=] seems like a natural fit.
