# Motivation and Summary # {#motivation-summary}

The Standard C++ Committee is starting to conduct more and more of our
  technical work in a virtual environment (see [[P2145R0]]), in part due to
  the current global pandemic.
This switch to remote work has required us to make changes to how we meet and
  collaborate.

To have effective virtual meetings, we need to evolve our consensus building
  process, because it has traditionally been in-person only. We are unlikely
  to meet in-person again until it is possible to do so without putting peoples'
  lives at risk.

We therefore propose that subgroup chairs be able to conduct subgroup
  [=straw polls=] asynchronously through an electronic polling service on
  isocpp.org.

## Consensus Building Mechanisms ## {#consensus-building-mechanisms}

<dfn>Synchronous Consensus Building</dfn> is a process for building consensus
  in which those involved meet at an appointed time (face-to-face or via
  telecon), discuss the subject matter, and then work to reach a consensus
  position before the end of the meeting.

<dfn>Asynchronous Consensus Building</dfn> is a process for building consensus
  in which a deadline is set, those involved discuss the subject matter (email,
  face-to-face, and/or telecon), and then work to reach a consensus decision
  before the deadline.

One of the main motivations for [=synchronous consensus building=] making is that
  it attempts to ensure that those voting on a poll are informed on the subject
  matter, as they were present for the discussion of the subject matter of the
  poll.
However, despite our best efforts, we cannot force participants to be engaged
  and follow the discussion, even if they are present.

There are a number of downsides to [=synchronous consensus building=]:

* It limits stakeholder involvement to those who can present at the meeting.
    For face-to-face meeting, this requires participants to travel to the
      meeting location.
    For telecon, it is almost impossible to avoid excluding some stakeholders
      due to time zone constraints.
* It often forces stakeholders present at meetings to choose which decisions
      they wish to be involved with.
    At the last few face-to-face meetings, we have had seven concurrent
      subgroups meeting for most of the week; it is almost impossible to avoid
      conflicts.
    For telecons, it is almost impossible to avoid excluding some stakeholders
      due to schedule constraints.
* It limits the amount of discussion that can proceed making a decision.
    Synchronous meeting time is a precious and limited resource.
* It does not leave time for reflection and reconsideration.
    [=Synchronous consensus building=] asks us to make a decision immediately
      after a discussion.
    While we can almost always reconsider decisions in light of new information
      or new perspectives, it is often wise to give stakeholders more time than
      a synchronous meeting can last to think about the decision and
      investigate open questions they may have.

[=Asynchronous consensus building=] addresses these shortcomings.
It allows more stakeholders to be involved in consensus building, equalizing
  the field by removing barriers to participation.
It removes the pressure and hastiness of trying to determine consensus before
  the end of a meeting, giving stakeholders more time to contemplate and decide
  their position.
This ensures that all opinions are ensured equally in the consensus building
  process, resulting in a better standard.

We believe that subgroup chairs should have access to
  [=asynchronous consensus building=] mechanisms in addition to the traditional
  [=synchronous consensus building=] mechanisms that we use today.

## Prior Art ## {#prior-art}

Historically, consensus building within the Standard C++ Committee has been
  synchronous and has occured at face-to-face meetings:

* <dfn>Straw Polls</dfn>: Subgroups have used informal polls during
      face-to-face meetings to decide whether to pursue proposals, provide
      directions for future revisions of proposals, make policy decisions, and
      forward proposals to other subgroups or plenaries.
    Anyone physically in attendance when a [=straw poll=] is taken is allowed to
      participate, including those who are visitors and do not yet have formal
      membership in a National Body.
    Typically, chairs discourage those who were not present for the discussion
      preceding the poll to not vote, but they are not disallowed from doing so.
    Decisions made in this way are not strictly binding; if new information or
      new perspectives are discovered, decisions can always be revisited.
* <dfn>Plenary Polls</dfn>: More formal polls are taken during plenaries at
      face-to-face meetings.
    Only formal Committee members may participate in plenary polls.
    Plenary polls are used to approve changes to the working draft of the C++
      International Standard or a C++ Technical Specification, create or advance
      work items to the next stage in their publication cycle, and make
      Committee-wide policy decisions.
    In the past few years, we have avoided technical discussion on the subject
      matter of a plenary poll during the plenary itself; technical discussion
      is supposed to happen in the applicable subgroups prior to plenary.

Some of the decisions made at plenary meetings, such as the creation and
  advancement of work items through their publication cycle, lead to
  asynchronous electronic ballots at the ISO level which then trickle down to
  our National Bodies, each of which uses their own consensus building process.
Typically these ISO ballots are open for a few weeks or months, giving ample time
  for stakeholders to consider the subject matter and make up their mind.

The parent organization of the US National Body, INCITS,
  [=Asynchronous Consensus Building|builds consensus asynchronously=] through
  electronic ballots or calls for comments which are open for a few weeks or
  months.

Another ISO programming language committee, the Standard Fortran Committee,
  makes synchronous decisions at face-to-face meetings.
However, many of these decisions are considered preliminary and are followed up
  with an electronic ballot within the Committee to determine consensus.
The below excerpt describes their process for one particular type of ballot:

> The rules for interpretation handling by which we operate say:
>
> * J3 votes on the answer at a J3 meeting; a simple majority vote marks the
>     answer as "passed by J3 meeting".
> * Between J3 meetings the chair of /interp sends a J3 letter ballot to J3 to
>       approve interp answers that have been "passed by J3 meeting".
>     The letter ballot runs for 30 days.
>     An interp answer passes by a 2/3rds vote; a no vote must be accompanied by
>       an explanation of the changes necessary to change the member's vote to
>       yes.
>     J3/interp reserves the right to recall an interp answer for more study
>       even if the answer passes.

# Proposed Changes # {#proposed-changes}

Today, the purpose of meetings is to make decisions.
Work on proposals is largely done outside of meetings.
At meetings, we review proposals, identifying where additional work is needed
  before a decision is made, and, when sufficient information is available,
  making decisions about how and if a proposal should proceed.

We propose a new model, where the purpose of meetings is to drive decision
  making, but not require that the decision making happen at the meetings
  themselves, especially for virtual meetings of our primary four groups.
Meetings would continue to be used to review and refine proposals and identify
  open questions.
However, instead of focusing on making decisions at meetings, we would instead
  focus on identifying the decisions that need to be made.

We propose that subgroup chairs should have the option to conduct subgroup
  [=straw polls=] asynchronously through an electronic polling service on
  isocpp.org to determine consensus.

Henceforth, [=straw polls=] should be divided into two categories:

* <dfn>Direction Straw Polls</dfn>: These polls are taken to suggest the
      direction that a proposal should pursue in the next revision that comes
      before the subgroup taking the poll.
    These polls will usually be taken on younger proposals, where there are still
      many open questions and areas for additional investigation.
    Direction [=straw polls=] can only be taken on proposals that will return to
      the same subgroup before proceeding further.
    The results of these polls can always be revisited if new information or new
      perspectives are discovered.
* <dfn>Decision Straw Polls</dfn>: These polls are taken to make decisions
      regarding a proposal once the subgroup is confident that all applicable
      and relevant aspects of the decision have been discussed.
    These polls will typically be taken on proposals that have been in the
      subgroup for a few revisions.
    Decision [=straw polls=] may forward proposals to other subgroups or to
      plenary.
    The results of these polls can always be revisited if new information or new
      perspectives are discovered.

We propose that the following guidelines should be followed when determining
  whether a poll should be taken synchronously or asynchronously:

* In Library Evolution, Library, Evolution, or Core, at the chair's discretion
    * [=decision straw polls=] shall be conducted either:
        * synchronously at face-to-face meetings, but not virtual meetings,
              (status quo), or
        * asynchronously via electronic straw poll.
    * [=direction straw polls=] shall be conducted either:
        * synchronously at face-to-face or virtual meetings (status quo), or
        * asynchronously via electronic straw poll.
* In study groups, at the chair's discretion both [=direction straw polls=] and
      [=decision straw polls=] shall be conducted either:
    * synchronously at face-to-face or virtual meetings (status quo), or
    * asynchronously via electronic straw poll.

# Electronic Straw Poll Specification # {#electronic-straw-poll-specification}

Electronic [=straw polls=] shall be conducted through a service on isocpp.org.

## Poll Structure ## {#poll-structure}

The service shall support five-way polls.

A five-way poll consists of an arbitrary statement, determined by the applicable
  subgroup chair.
Poll statements shall not be changed after the poll has begun.

Polls should provide links to any papers applicable to the polls, relevant
  minutes for those papers, prior polls, and the GitHub issue for said papers.

In a five-way poll, voters may select a stance on the statement being polled
  from these five options:

* Strongly For.
* Weakly For.
* Neutral.
* Weakly Against.
* Strongly Against.

## Eligibility for Voting ## {#eligibility-for-voting}

The service shall use the same login system as the isocpp.org paper submission
  service.

An individual is eligible to obtain an isocpp.org account and participate in
  a subgroup's electronic [=straw polls=] if they are any of the following:

* A member of a National Body that participates in the Standard C++ Committee,
    e.g. someone who is in the ISO Global Directory.
* Any person who has attended one of the past three face-to-face meetings.

## Voting ## {#voting}

Each voter may participate once on each poll.

Voters shall leave a comment in addition to their vote.

Each voter may change their vote and comment at any time prior to the closing of
  a vote.

Each voter should be prompted to confirm that they have read the proposal and
  are familiar with the topic.

The voting system shall follow best practices for accessibility.
If any voter is unable to vote using the voting system for whatever reason, they
  may submit their vote by emailing the chair who created the poll.

## Creation of Polls ## {#creation-of-polls}

Subgroup chairs may create polls.

## Discussion Prior to Polling ## {#discussion-prior-to-polling}

The subject of a poll shall be discussed either at a meeting or via the
  applicable mailing list prior to the start of a poll.

Chairs shall notify voters 48 hours prior to the start of a poll and distribute
  a draft of the poll statement for feedback.
The 48 hour notification period  should be subject to change based on field
  experience.
A few months after we begin electronic polling, we should gather feedback and
  determine if the notification period needs to be increased or decreased.

## Poll Notifications ## {#poll-notifications}

A new mailing list, polls@lists.isocpp.org, shall be established.
This mailing list shall be used for notifications regarding polls, but not for
  discussions of polls or poll results.

Once a poll has started, chairs shall notify the applicable mailing lists and
  polls@lists.isocpp.org.

At the start of any subgroup meeting, if that subgroup has open polls, the chair
  shall notify the group of said polls.

## Poll Duration ## {#poll-duration}

The subgroup chair creating a poll shall be able to set a deadline date for the
  poll.
The deadline should be in Anywhere on Earth (AoE) time (UTC-12).
The suggested duration is 2 weeks.
The 2 week duration guideline should be subject to change based on field
  experience.
A few months after we begin electronic polling, we should gather feedback and
  determine if the polling period needs to be increased or decreased.

## Poll Results ## {#poll-results}

The position and comments of all voters shall remain hidden, until the poll
  closes.
When the poll closes, the position and comments shall be visible to all
  committee members and shall be attributed to the voter who made them.

Once a poll closes, the chair who created the poll shall receive an email
  notifying them that the poll is over.
Then, the chair who created the poll shall distribute their interpretation of
  what consensus is based on the poll results via the applicable mailing lists,
  minutes pages, and/or GitHub issues.

No one shall share the identities and positions of voters with those who are
  not eligible voters without the explicit permission of said voters.
Poll statements, vote counts, and the chair's interpretation of the results
  may be shared with anyone.

# FAQ # {#faq}

<b>Q: Do you think we should stop having face-to-face meetings entirely?</b>

No.

Developing processes for collaborating remotely and electronically does not mean
  ceasing our face-to-face collaborations.
Face-to-face meetings have value and we believe face-to-face meetings should
  be held in the future.
We do believe that enabling remote participation in such meetings is important.

<b>Q: Won't electronic [=straw polls=] allow people who weren't involved in discussion at a meeting to vote?</b>

Yes.

In synchronous decision making, we discourage those who were not present for the
  discussion prior to a poll from voting because they do not have time to
  familiarize themselves with the discussion before the poll is taken.
In asynchronous decision making, those not present for a discussion will have
  ample time to familiarize themselves with the discussion and background.

It is true that some people may choose to not familiarize themselves with the
  subject matter and prior discussions and still vote.
However, synchronous decision making is also susceptible to inattentiveness.
The presence of an individual at a particular meeting does not imply that they
  were paying attention during the meeting.

The best we can do is what we have always done: encourage people to either
  familiarize themselves with the subject matter and discussion or choose to not
  vote.

Additionally, unlike at face-to-face meetings, chairs will have a list of
  everyone who voted in the poll and how they voted.
If any sort of voting irregularities appear, the added transparency will make
  it very noticable.
If such irregularities do occur, we can correct them and adjust our process.

We make decisions by consensus, not majority.
If the chair has reason to believe the results of the poll do not reflect the
  consensus of the subgroup, the poll can be discarded.  that the results of the
  poll are not valid,

<b>Q: Will my vote and comments on a poll be publicly attributed to me outside of the committee?</b>

No, unless you choose to make them public yourself.

Poll results will follow the same rules we use for minutes today:

* The poll statement, numeric results, and chair's interpretation of consensus
    of a poll can be made publicly available.
* Anonymized summaries of comments can be made publicly available.
* Attribution of votes or comments to specific individuals, companies, or
    National Bodies without their express permission is forbidden.

<b>Q: What about plenary and [=plenary polls=]?</b>

This proposal does not suggest any changes to our plenary process at this time.
We believe incremental change is safer than drastic change.
We suggest that the Standard C++ Committee start pursuing electronic
  [=straw polls=] for subgroups and assess the effectiveness and ramifications
  of this change in a few months before considering further process changes.

There is no pressing need to hold a plenary meeting for the next few months.
We do not need to advance any Standard C++ work items to the next publication
  stage in the immediate future.

In the future, if we decide to electronically ballot [=plenary polls=], there
  are already systems in place to handle electronic balloting of formal
  individual members within an ISO committee.
ISO provides a electronic balloting system which we could use to poll the
  individual membership.
ISO ballots for creating or advancing work items to the next publication stage
  are voted on by National Bodies, not the individual members.
However, ISO provides another type of ballot,
  <a href="https://helpdesk-docs.iso.org/article/318-create-wg">Working Group consultations</a>,
  which the formal individual members of a Committee vote on.

Given that technical discussion is already discouraged for [=plenary polls=]
  and is intended to happen disjointly in subgroups prior the plenary,
  electronic voting for [=plenary polls=] seems like a natural fit.
