# Motivation # {#motivation}

For forseeable future, the Standard C++ Committee will be conducting our
  technical work in a virtual environment.
The switch to remote work has required us to make changes to our review process
  (see [[P2145]]).

We also need to evolve our decision making process.
We propose that subgroup chairs should have the option to conduct subgroup straw
  polls asynchronously through an electronic polling service on isocpp.org.

## Asynchronous & Synchronous Decision Making ## {#asynchronous-and-synchronous-decision-making}

**Synchronous decision making** is a process for making decisions in which those
  involved meet at an appointed time (face-to-face or via telecon), discuss
  the subject matter, and then vote on the decision.

**Asynchronous decision making** is a process for making decisions in which an
  arbitrary deadline is set, those involved discuss the subject matter (email,
  face-to-face, and/or telecon), and vote on the decision before the deadline.

One of the main motivations for synchronous decision making is that it attempts
  to ensures that those voting on a poll are informed on the subject matter, as
  they were present for the discussion of the subject matter of the poll.
However, despite our best efforts, we cannot force participants to be engaged
  and follow the discussion, even if they are present.

There are a number of downsides to synchronous decision making:

* It limits stakeholder involvement to those who can present at the meeting.
  For face-to-face meeting, this requires participants to travel to the meeting
    location.
  For telecon, it is almost impossible to avoid excluding some stakeholders due
    to time zone constraints.
* It often forces stakeholers present at to choose which decisions they wish to
    be involved with.
  At the last few face-to-face meetings, we have had seven concurrent subgroups
    meeting for most of the week; it is almost impossible to avoid conflicts.
  For telecons, it is almost impossible to avoid excluding some stakeholers due
    to schedule constraints.
* It limits the amount of discussion that can proceed making a decision.
  Synchronous meeting time is a precious and limited resource.
* It does not leave time for reflection and reconsideration.
  Synchronous decision making asks us to make a decision immediately after a
    discussion.
  While we can almost always reconsider decisions in light of new information or
    new perspectives, it is often wise to give stakeholders more time than a
    synchronus meeting can last to think about the decision and investigate
    open questions they may have.

Asynchronous decision making addresses these shortcomings.
It allows more stakeholders to be involved in decision making and allows
  stakeholders to spend more time deciding their position.

We believe that subgroup chairs should have access to asynchronous decision
  making mechanisms in addition to the traditional synchronous decision making
  mechanisms that we use today.

## Prior Art ## {#prior-art}

Historically, decision making within the Committee has been synchronous and has
  occured at face-to-face meetings:

* **Straw Polls in Subgroups:** Subgroups have used informal polls during
    face-to-face meetings to decide whether to pursue proposals, provide
    directions for future revisions of proposals, make policy decisions, and
    forward proposals to other subgroups or plenaries.
  Anyone physically in attendance when a straw poll is taken is allowed to
    participate, including those who are visitors and do not yet have formal
    membership in a National Body.
  Typically, chairs discourage those who were not present for the discussion
    preceding the poll to not vote, but they are not disallowed from doing so.
  Decisions made in this way are not strictly binding; if new information or new
    perspectives are discovered, decisions can always be revisited.
* **Plenary Polls:** More formal polls are taken during plenaries at
    face-to-face meetings.
  Only formal Committee members may participate in plenary polls.
  Plenary polls are used to approve changes to the working draft of the C++
    International Standard or a C++ Technical Specification, create or advance
    work items to the next stage in their publication cycle, and make
    Committee-wide policy decisions.
  In the past few years, we have avoided technical discussion on the subject
    matter of a plenary poll during the plenary itself; technical discussion
    is supposed to happen in the applicable subgroups prior to plenary.

Some of the decisions made at plenary meetings, such as the creation and
  advancement of work items through their publication cycle, lead to
  asynchronous electronic ballots at the ISO level which then trickle down to
  our National Bodies, each of which uses their own decision making process.
Typically these ISO ballots are open for a few weeks or months, giving ample time
  for stakeholders to consider the subject matter and make up their mind.

The parent organization of the US National Body, INCITS, makes most decisions
  asynchronously through electronic ballots or calls for comments which are open
  for a few weeks or months.

Our sister organization, the Standard Fortran Committee, makes synchronous
  decisions at face-to-face meetings.
However, many of these decisions are considered preliminary and are followed up
  with an electronic ballot within the Committee.
The below excerpt describes their process for one particular type of ballot:

> The rules for interpretation handling by which we operate say:
>
> * J3 votes on the answer at a J3 meeting; a simple majority vote marks the
>     answer as "passed by J3 meeting".
> * Between J3 meetings the chair of /interp sends a J3 letter ballot to J3 to
>     approve interp answers that have been "passed by J3 meeting".
>   The letter ballot runs for 30 days.
>   An interp answer passes by a 2/3rds vote; a no vote must be accompanied by
>     an explanation of the changes necessary to change the member's vote to yes.
>   J3/interp reserves the right to recall an interp answer for more study even
>     if the answer passes.

# Proposed Changes # {#proposed-changes}

We propose that subgroup chairs should have the option to conduct subgroup straw
  polls asynchronously through an electronic polling service on isocpp.org.

Henceforth, straw polls should be divided into two categories:

* **Direction Straw Polls:** These polls are taken to suggest the direction that
    a proposal should pursue in the next revision that comes before the subgroup
    taking the poll.
  These polls will usually be taken on younger proposals, where there are still
    many open questions and areas for additional investigation.
  Direction Straw Polls can only be taken on proposals that will return to the
    same subgroup before proceeding further.
  The results of these polls can always be revisited if new information or new
    perspectives are discovered.
  Direction Straw Polls may be taken either synchronously at meetings or
    asynchronously via electronic ballot.
* **Decision Straw Polls:** These polls are taken to make decisions regarding a
    proposal once the subgroup is confident that all applicable and relevant
    aspects of the decision have been discussed.
  These polls will typically be taken on proposals that have been in the
    subgroup for a few revisions.
  Decision Straw Polls may forward proposals to other subgroups or to plenary.
  The results of these polls can always be revisited if new information or new
    perspectives are discovered.
  Decision Straw polls must be taken asynchronously via electronic ballot.

Today, the purpose of meetings is to make decisions.
Work on proposals is largely done outside of meetings.
At meetings, we review proposals, identifying where additional work is needed
  before a decision is made, and, when sufficient information is available,
  making decisions about how and if a proposal should proceed.

We propose a new model, where the purpose of meetings is to drive decision
  making.
Meetings would continue to be used to review and refine proposals and identify
  open questions.
However, instead of focusing on making decisions at meetings, we would instead
  focus on identifying the decisions that need to be made.
Some decision making would continue to occur at meetings, such as anything that
  would qualify for a Guidance Straw Poll could be decided at a meeting.
But, major decisions would be asynchronously via electronic ballots.

# Electronic Straw Poll Specification # {#electronic-straw-poll-specification}

Electronic straw polls shall be conducted through a service on isocpp.org.

## Poll Structure ## {#poll-structure}

The service shall support five-way polls.

A five-way poll consists of an arbitrary statement, determined by the applicable
  subgroup chair.
Poll statements shall not be changed after the poll has begun.

In a five-way poll, voters may select a stance on the statement being polled
  from these five options:

* Strongly For.
* Weakly For.
* Neutral.
* Weakly Against.
* Strongly Against.

## Eligiblity for Voting ## {#eligibility-for-voting}

The service shall use the same login system as the isocpp.org paper submission
  service.

An individual is eligible to obtain an isocpp.org account and participate in
  a subgroup's electronic straw polls if they are any of the following:

* A member of a National Body that participates in the Standard C++ Committee,
    including any employee of a company that is already a member of a National
    Body.
* Any person who has attended a face-to-face meeting in the past.
* Any person who has authored a proposal to the subgroup.
* Any individual who has been invited by the subgroup's chair.

## Voting ## {#voting}

Each voter may participant once on each poll.

Voters shall be able to leave a comment in addition to their vote.

Each voter may change their vote and comment at any time prior to the closing of
  a vote.

## Creation of Polls ## {#creation-of-polls}

Subgroup chairs may create polls.

## Discussion Prior to Polling ## {#discussion-prior-to-polling}

The subject of a poll shall be discussed either at a meeting or via the
  applicable mailing list prior to the start of a poll.

Chairs shall notify voters 48 hours prior to the start of a poll and distribute
  a draft of the poll statement for feedback.

## Poll Notifications ## {#poll-notifications}

A new mailing list, polls@lists.isocpp.org, shall be established.
This mailing list shall be used for notifications regarding polls, but not for
  discussions of polls or poll results.

Once a poll has started, chairs shall notify the applicable mailing lists and
  polls@lists.isocpp.org.

At the start of any subgroup meeting, if that subgroup has open polls, the chair
  shall notify the group of said polls.

## Poll Deadlines ## {#poll-deadlines}

Each poll shall be open for voting for at least two weeks.

## Poll Results ## {#poll-results}

The votes and comments of all voters shall be visible to all other voters.

Once a poll closes, the chair who created the poll shall distribute an
  interpretation of the poll results via the applicable mailing lists, minutes
  pages, and/or GitHub issues.

No one shall share the identities and positions of voters with non-voters
  without the explicit permission of said voters.
Poll statements, vote counts, and the chair's interpretation of the results
  may be shared externally.

# FAQ # {#faq}

**Q: Won't electronic straw polls allow people who weren't involved in discussion at a meeting to vote?**

Yes.

In synchronous decision making, we discourage those who were not present for the
  discussion prior to a poll to not vote because they do not have time to
  familiarize themselves with the discussion before the poll is taken.
In asynchronous decision making, those not present for a discussion will have
  ample time (at least two weeks) to familiarize themselves with the discussion
  and background.

It is true that some people may choose to not familiarize themselves with the
  subject matter and prior discussions and still vote.
However, synchronous decision making is also susceptible to inattentiveness.
The presence of an individual at a particular meeting does not imply that they
  were paying attention during the meeting.

The best we can do is what we have always done: encourage people to either
  familiarize themselves with the subject matter and discussion or choose to not
  vote.

**Q: What about plenary and plenary polls?**

This proposal does not suggest any changes to our plenary process at this time.
We believe incremental change is safer than drastic change.
We suggest that the Standard C++ Committee start pursuing electronic straw
  polls for subgroups and assess the effectiveness and ramifications of this
  change in a few months before considering further process changes.

There is no pressing need to hold a plenary meeting for the next few months.
We do not need to advance any Standard C++ work items to the next publication
  stage in the immediate future.

The US National Body, INCITS PL22.16, typically meets jointly with our
  international ISO Committee.
INCITS PL22.16 is required to hold two meetings (either face-to-face or
  virtual) a year and has only held one in 2020.
Failure to attend these meetings can jeopardize voting membership.
So, regardless of anything else we do, it will be necessary for a very large
  part of the Standard C++ Committee to hold a telecon before the end of the
  year.

In the future, if we decide to electronically ballot plenary polls, there are
  already systems in place to handle electronic balloting of formal individual
  members within an ISO committee.
ISO provides a electronic balloting system which we could use to poll the
  individual membership.
ISO ballots for creating or advancing work items to the next publication stage
  are voted on by National Bodies, not the individual members.
However, ISO provides another type of ballot,
  <a href="https://helpdesk-docs.iso.org/article/318-create-wg">Working Group consultations</a>,
  which the formal individual members of a Committee vote on.

Given that technical discussion is already discouraged for plenary polls and
  is intended to happen disjointly in subgroups prior the plenary, electronic
  voting for plenary polls seems like a natural fit.
